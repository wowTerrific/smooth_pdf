# smooth_pdf
A simple tool to copy a PDF into a "flattened" version of itself with no form fields or text. 

This will render a PDF, create an image from it, and then transform the image back to a PDF format. 

I would not recommend this library for usage outside of creating "read only" PDFs for public visibility.
